# Herosquad

There is a hero inside everyone of us.

### what is herosquad ? or what it wants to be ?

#### the current context of reality:

World is full of people, some of them are nicer than evil, some of them are more evil than nice.
People who are evil are yet not balanced, they're full of anger, they want revenge of what they suffered in past, or they're still suffering. Usually those people are victims of someone else, with more power than themselves. However, in order to discharge all their frustration, they find weaker victim to make them pay for that.
Those ones, the (at this moment) weak people who cannot stand for themselves, need help.

Bullying is a reality, it's cruel, it should not exist in a balanced society, but it does right now at this moment.

If you have the power to just stand and face a bully on behalf of someone that is very scared of it, you can make a difference in your environment.

We don't ask you to fight against the bully, the bully also is suffering in his/her own way. We only ask you to show to the victim that he/she can count on you, that he/she is not alone and people are able to support others.
We don't want injustice in our world. We don't want violence, we only want peace. Let's take action for it.

Herosquad is intending to provide a person a tool to ask helo to the hero squad, as soon as he/she needs it.
