## What is Hero Squad ?

### Curent context

There is 7 billion people living in this world right now.  
Some of them are nice and gentle; some of them are not.  
It's ok not being nice. The problem comes when people is aggresive, hostile.  
Those who are hostile are yet not balanced. They're full of anger. They are probably venting their own frustration over inocent people.
Bullies, as we called them, mostly are also victims of someone stronger than themselves.

####Think this:

A kid in school is a bully with his classmates, he ruin their days everytime he intimidates them, throwing their books, play a rude prank over them, or take their lunch.  
That same frightening kid in school, is being bullied in his own home. His dad might be an alcoholic, being drunk every evening, punching his mom in front of him, intimidating him and being really mean by words onto him.  
That's how a potentially great person (when children, we're full of potential for greatness) become mean. By being exposed to violence and unbalance at very early age.

Also, there is this another type of kid, he has been living in a comfortable environment, growing up with nice parents, and no violence in his home. He is, by association, a nice person.  
This kid, though is a nice and warm person, usually don't know how to protect themselves from violence, and it makes sense, since they never have been exposed to it, so they never needed to learn that skill, until now...
This kid is the grasshopper, or the apprentice. He needs to walk a path towards his own independence and self acceptance, but until then, he needs help.

Now, here comes the 3rd type of kid, the hero. This is the kid that has self confidence, knows about respect and honor, and kindness with others, and is able to take action to intercede for help people in trouble.
This kid is the key to stop bullyness, he's the one that can stand up for his friend in help, and start the change.

#### We all can, and have been heroes at some point of our lives.
Being a hero is about forgeting selfishness and helping others for a moment.
Help to change a flat tire, lend money to a friend in trouble, providing company for a friend in emotional pain, all of that is detaching from our egos and providing assitance to another human being.

Bullying is a reality, it's cruel, it should not exist in a balanced society, but it does exist right now and we can do something to stop it.

If you have the power to just stand and face a bully on behalf of someone that is very scared of it, you can make a difference in your environment.

We don't ask you to fight against the bully, the bully also is suffering in his/her own way. We only ask you to show to the grasshopper that he/she can count on you, that he/she is not alone and people are able to support others.
We don't want injustice in our world. We don't want violence, we want peace and freedom. Let's take action for it.

### Goals
Herosquad is a platform that aims to achieve the following goals:

- To train a grasshopper, to embrace them as apprentices and teach them how to defend themselves.
- To train a hero, you might be a potential hero and you might not notice it yet.
- To show a bully that violence is not the answer, to teach them that when someone hurts you, the answer is not to replicate the same in others, but to stop them, and ask for help ! We're not alone !
